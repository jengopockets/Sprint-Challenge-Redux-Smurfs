1.  Describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

1.  What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?

1.  What is middleware?
